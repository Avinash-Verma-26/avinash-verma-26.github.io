        <p>Welcome to my personal biography page! Here, you'll learn a bit about my journey, interests, and what makes me tick.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe">Early Life</a></h3>
        <p>I was born on a sunny day in May 1990, in the small town of Springfield. Growing up, I always had a fascination with technology and how things worked. This curiosity led me to dismantle and (sometimes successfully) reassemble various household gadgets, much to my parents' dismay.</p>
